== Description ==
This plugin aims to bot attacks. I took Ionut Staicu’s idea with his ntzAntiSpam and I went with it to the next level. Many of us know that spam bots make some tests before completing the inputs. They seek only the items which may be visible by human eye. wit_AntiSpam creates a new element “visible” for robots but invisible for humans. If that element is filled by something , the protection system will block the page. Untill now i described only Mr Staicu’s work. Optimization and quality improvement begin from here. wit_AntiSpam create the new element based on a random list which will set up the “trap” element on other position and with different name. The trap element will make bot system detection almost imposible.

Noted that this runs already on this blog, and in case you notice behavior problems or other troubles (bugs for example) I will appreciate very much feedback about them.
